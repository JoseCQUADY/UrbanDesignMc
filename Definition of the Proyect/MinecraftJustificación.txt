Justificación
-Minecraft es el segundo juego más vendido de la historia
-Using Minecraft students may develop skills such as creativity, leadership, differentiation, collaboration,
digital citizenship, fun and engagement.
-Con metodologías como block by block, que usan minecraft como erramienta de colaboración y visualisación,
 se le ha dado una voz a los jovenes, etos usalamente no tienen voz en la planación de los espacios urbanos
-Ecocrafta ha añadido manejo de presupuesto a minecraft e impacto ambiental. Ecocraft era un programa de 
la UN-Enviorment para experimentar con problemas de planeación de energía, manejo de desperdicios y transporte
-In the article “Connecting 3D models and GIS with Minecraft” [33], the author argued that community 
collaboration strengthens the sense of belonging and enhances consensual design outcomes. He 
stresses that young people are generally excluded from urban plnning, and that Minecraft is a powerful
tool thaht can change that.

-Minecraft as a Tool for Engaging Children in Urban Planning: A Case Study in Tirol Town, Brazil:
*CHildren were able to locate their houses; correlate the map with real landscape; align the digital, real and mental 
mapping; comprehend basic cartographic principles such as metric proportion, scale, coordinate 
system, symbols and legends; better understand architecture (building materials, implementation,
*Although children had no guidance or recommendations regarding the ecological dimensions
of designing their town, they built natural light-centric buildings incorporating rainwater re-use,
community gardening, and vegetation conservation. This was similar the Ecocraft experiment that
the Dutch initiative mentioned previously, and confirms the potential of climate-led approaches to
Minecraft and the tendency of children to consider these aspects in design decisions
*The digital game environment built in Minecraft, Tirolcraft, demonstrated that using a game as
a tool can motivate, inspire and engage very young and older children to participate in the urban
planning process.
*The two experiments demonstrated that Minecraft could be used as a tool encouraging democratic
and inclusive civic participation. The engagement was combined with the introduction of a ludic
experience that enabled a relationship with the places as well as the toys. The game environment was
able to break down complex issues into simple ones. The first experiment showed that Minecraft is a
suitable tool for children to engage with the design processes, even very young ones.
*Children were motivated by geogames.
Children had a tendency to get distracted while they were not playing. Minecraft as a geogame
became a participatory urban planning tool, a block-building thinking logic that allowed children to
recreate their town digitally
