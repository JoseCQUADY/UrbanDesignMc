Urban design using minecraft

Objective: Allow children to contribute to the urban planning of parks
in Mérida city.

We will use "Minecraft" as a tool to know what kids want to do in parks
by using a methodology. We want to do this project in collaboration with
the government of the state of Yucatán.

Innovation: In Mérida the "Block by Block" methodology has never been
used.

The difference lies in the change of scenario, what works in one
scenario doesn't necessarily work in another, because people have a
different background and also are other cultural and social differences.

Justification: The "Block by Block" methodology allows children to
contribute to urban planning, as in Tirol (the most recent use of this
methodology).

The "Block by Block" methodology was created by the United Nations and
Mojang Studios, and it has been efficient at allowing the residents to
participate in urban planning by using Minecraft.

The collaborative nature allows the creation of more inclusive and user
centered cities.

The Tirol case is important because it proved that younger kids, 4-7,
where able to use Minecraft and build Tirol the way they wanted.

Requirements:

Accessible and intuitive for children of different ages and abilities.

Commitment: A variety of recreational activities that are engaging and
stimulating for children.

Fun and Motivating: The system should be fun and motivating for
children, encouraging their active participation and interest in urban
design through engaging and rewarding gaming experiences.

Immersion and Engagement: The system should provide an immersive and
captivating experience that holds the users interest and attention,
using game design techniques that promote engagement and active
participation.
